Description: The underlying package FLGP provides algorithms to make fast inference
    in the large scale data by heat kernel GPs, which utilize the intrinsic manifold 
    geometry. The fast computation benefits from subsampling, constructing 
    a reduced-rank approximation of the similarity matrix and truncated SVD.
    More details refer to the original paper. The package consists of 
    Gaussian process classification and Gaussian process regression algorithms.
